We can help with both, and we have designed policies and processes to ensure that YouGov and our clients comply with all applicable privacy and data security obligations. You can find out more about this below.

                    When we use our panel to provide you with anonymous insights, we are the sole
                    <b>data controller</b>
                     of the survey data that is collected, because we determine the purposes and means of processing. In other words, we have developed proprietary research methodologies to ensure the right people are invited to the right survey at the right time so that we can provide you with meaningful insights.
